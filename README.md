# minishell
42 School project


Through the Minishell project, you will get to the core of the Unix system and explore an important part of this system’s API: process creation and synchronisation. Executing a command inside a shell implies creating a new process, which execution and final state will be monitored by its parent’s process. This set of functions will be the key to success for your Minishell.

Here is an example of minishell:

Implemented commands:
- cd;
- setenv;
- unsetenv;
- env;
- echo;
- exit.

Bonuses:
- management of execution rights in the PATH;
- auto completion;
- separation of commands with ";";
- history;
- prompt shows current folder;
- nice design;
