Through the Minishell project, you will get to the core of the Unix system and explore an important part of this system’s API: process creation and synchronisation. Executing a command inside a shell implies creating a new process, which execution and final state will be monitored by its parent’s process. This set of functions will be the key to success for your Minishell.

## About minishell

Also, for bonus part I did:

- management of execution rights in the PATH;

- separation of commands with ";";
- history;
- prompt shows current folder;
- nice design.
